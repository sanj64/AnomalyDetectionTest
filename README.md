# Anomaly Detection Demo
Coding Task for REYES 2025 project "AI-Powered Space Mission Risk Prediction Framework"

## About the Project
### AI-Powered Space Mission Risk Prediction Framework
This project develops an AI-driven framework for predictive risk assessment and real-time anomaly detection in space missions, addressing the limitations of traditional static models. It combines deep learning to forecast potential system failures, machine learning algorithms for live telemetry anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning for autonomous risk-mitigation decision-making. By enhancing spacecraft self-reliance and operational resilience, the framework aims to reduce mission failure rates and enable adaptive responses in unpredictable conditions. A functional Python-based prototype will validate the systemâ€™s performance, laying the foundation for next-generation space safety infrastructure.

### Building Prototype 
As a part of the project, I have built this python-based model detects anomalies using **Isolation Forest**. <br/>

## How to run the script yourselves?

#### Clone the repository:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AnomalyDetectionDemo.git
cd AnomalyDetectionDemo
```
#### Create a virtual environment (best practice):

```
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the script:

```
python anomaly_detector.py
```
